I am a recent UCLA graduate enthusiastic about the intersections between science, technology, and society.

Currently, I am actively pursuing opportunities in software engineering, data science, and bioinformatics. I am excited to apply my skillset to a myriad of situations in industry. I am also adaptable to learning different languages, frameworks, and platforms.

In my free time, I enjoy planting trees, reading about math, and telling stories. Hopefully this website eventually grows into both a math and writing blog.
